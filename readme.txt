ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project is developing a text-based game where the user will guide a
party of players through a dungeon, fighting monsters, solving puzzles, and 
interacting with characters. There is an evil Sorcerer that has captured these
players and they must make it out with as many players alive as possible! To win, 
the party must clear all 5 rooms with at least one other party member when they 
reach the dungeon exit before the Sorcerer's anger reaches 100. There willl be a 
final battle against the Sorcerer before they can escape the dunfeon!!!
